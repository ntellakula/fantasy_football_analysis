    "## Win Shares\n",
    "The first metric I'm looking at is Win Shares. An **advanced statistic** in NBA and MLB circles, this metric is usually a box-score conglomerate. For the sake of fantasy football, our box scores are relatively straightforward - the only value of interest is points. As a result, positive Win Shares only count each player's point contribution to each win and is then summed up. It's not a groundbreaking formula by any means but it sheds light on which players were the most dominant in combination with other players on a team. Win Shares show context of the team and manager rather than focusing just on total points."
